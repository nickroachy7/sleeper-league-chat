## Sync Script Updates

Updated `sync_sleeper_data.py` with new sync functions:
- `sync_nfl_state()` - Syncs current NFL week/season
- `sync_traded_picks()` - Syncs traded draft picks
- `sync_drafts()` - Syncs draft metadata and picks
- `sync_playoff_brackets()` - Syncs playoff matchups

The `full_sync()` function now includes all new data sources.

## Current Data Stats

After running the sync:
- **NFL State**: 1 record (Week 8, Season 2025)
- **Drafts**: 1 draft
- **Draft Picks**: 48 picks
- **Traded Picks**: 135 picks across multiple seasons
- **Playoff Brackets**: 14 matchups (7 winners + 7 losers)
- **Players**: 3,968 players
- **Leagues**: 1 league
- **Users**: 13 users
- **Rosters**: 12 rosters
- **Matchups**: 84 matchups (weeks 1-7)
- **Transactions**: 504 transactions

## Usage Examples

### Check current NFL week
```python
from league_queries import get_nfl_state
state = get_nfl_state()
print(f"Current: Week {state['week']}, Season {state['season']}")
```

### View traded picks for 2026
```python
from league_queries import get_traded_picks
picks = get_traded_picks(season="2026")
for pick in picks:
    print(f"{pick['season']} Round {pick['round']}: {pick['original_owner']} → {pick['current_owner']}")
```

### See a team's draft capital
```python
from league_queries import get_team_draft_capital
capital = get_team_draft_capital(team_name="Dynasty Reloaded")
print(f"{capital['team_name']} has {len(capital['picks'])} picks")
```

### View draft results
```python
from league_queries import get_draft_results
draft = get_draft_results()
print(f"{draft['season']} Draft - {len(draft['picks'])} total picks")
for pick in draft['picks'][:5]:  # First 5 picks
    print(f"Pick {pick['pick_no']}: {pick['player_name']} to {pick['team']}")
```

### Check playoff bracket
```python
from league_queries import get_playoff_bracket
bracket = get_playoff_bracket()
print(f"Winners Bracket: {len(bracket['winners_bracket'])} matchups")
print(f"Losers Bracket: {len(bracket['losers_bracket'])} matchups")
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Row Level Security (RLS) Not Enabled**

The Supabase security advisor indicates that RLS is not enabled on any tables. This is acceptable for this use case since:
1. This is a read-only API for league data
2. All league data is meant to be visible to all league members
3. Using service role key for backend access only
4. No user-specific authentication or data isolation needed

If you plan to expose the Supabase API directly to the frontend, consider enabling RLS policies.

See: [Supabase RLS Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/database-linter?lint=0013_rls_disabled_in_public)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
1. **Trending Players** - Track adds/drops from Sleeper API
2. **Player Stats** - Historical player performance data
3. **Waiver Wire Analysis** - Track waiver activity patterns
4. **Trade Analysis** - Analyze trade patterns and values
5. **League History** - Multi-season data tracking via `previous_league_id`

## Testing

All new functions have been tested and verified:
- ✅ NFL State retrieval working
- ✅ Traded picks query working (135 picks found)
- ✅ Playoff bracket query working (14 matchups)
- ✅ Draft results query working (48 picks)
- ✅ Team draft capital query working
- ✅ All database relationships intact
- ✅ Sync script runs successfully

## Files Modified

1. **Database Schema**
   - New migration: `add_missing_sleeper_tables`
   - Added 5 new tables with indexes and constraints

2. **Python Files**
   - `sync_sleeper_data.py` - Added 6 new fetch functions, 5 new sync functions
   - `league_queries.py` - Added 5 new query functions with definitions

3. **Documentation**
   - `NEW_ENDPOINTS_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Conclusion

Your Sleeper League Chat application now has comprehensive access to:
- ✅ League and roster data
- ✅ Matchup and scoring data
