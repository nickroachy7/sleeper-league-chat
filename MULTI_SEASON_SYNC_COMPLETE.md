## Sync Script Enhancements

### Before (Single Season)
```python
def full_sync(league_id: str, current_week: int = 7):
    # Only synced current season
    # Required manual week count
```

### After (Multi-Season with Auto-Detection)
```python
def full_sync(league_id: str, sync_history: bool = True):
    # Discovers all seasons automatically
    # Detects current week from NFL state
    # Syncs appropriate data per season status
```

### Smart Week Detection

```python
if status == 'complete':
    weeks_to_sync = range(1, 19)  # All 18 weeks
elif status == 'in_season' and is_current:
    nfl_state = fetch_nfl_state()
    current_week = nfl_state.get('week', 7)
    weeks_to_sync = range(1, current_week + 1)  # Through current week
```

## Query Functions - Now Season-Aware

All existing query functions work seamlessly with multi-season data:

### Get Standings (Current Season)
```python
standings = get_standings()  # Automatically uses current league_id
```

### Historical Queries
You can query any season by league_id:

```python
# 2023 standings
from league_queries import get_supabase_client
supabase = get_supabase_client()
result = supabase.table('rosters').select('*').eq('league_id', '990713355411271680').execute()

# 2024 standings
result = supabase.table('rosters').select('*').eq('league_id', '1048274277511962624').execute()

# 2025 standings (current)
result = supabase.table('rosters').select('*').eq('league_id', '1180365427496943616').execute()
```

## Database Schema Enhancements

### League Connections
```
leagues (2025)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ previous_league_id ‚Üí leagues (2024)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ previous_league_id ‚Üí leagues (2023)
```

### Data Relationships
All data properly links to the correct season's league_id:
- Matchups ‚Üí League (by season)
- Transactions ‚Üí League (by season)
- Rosters ‚Üí League (by season)
- Drafts ‚Üí League (by season)
- Traded Picks ‚Üí League (includes future seasons)

## Conflict Resolution

Fixed upsert conflicts for multi-season syncing:

```python
# Matchups
.upsert(records, on_conflict='league_id,roster_id,week')

# Traded Picks
.upsert(records, on_conflict='league_id,season,round,roster_id')

# Playoff Brackets
.upsert(records, on_conflict='league_id,bracket_type,round,matchup_id')
```

## Usage Examples

### Run Complete Historical Sync
```bash
python3 sync_sleeper_data.py
```

This will:
1. Discover all seasons (follows `previous_league_id` chain)
2. Sync each season in chronological order
3. Load appropriate weeks based on status
4. Sync players once at the end

### Sync Only Current Season
```python
from sync_sleeper_data import full_sync
full_sync(SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID, sync_history=False)
```

```sql
SELECT season, name, status, total_rosters 
FROM leagues 
ORDER BY season;
