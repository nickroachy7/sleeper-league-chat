# Migration Guide: Upgrading to Query Enhancement v2

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Test Standalone (Recommended First)

Test the new system without affecting your production setup:

```bash
# Test the enhanced assistant in CLI mode
python3 fantasy_assistant_v2.py

# Or run the test suite
python3 test_query_enhancement.py
```

Try these questions to see the improvements:
- "How are my IR players performing?"
- "Compare the top 3 teams' rosters"
- "Who's the most traded player?"

### Option 2: Integrate into API Server

Once you're satisfied with v2, integrate it into your API:

**Simple approach (replace v1 entirely):**

```python
# In api_server.py, change line 8:

# OLD:
from fantasy_assistant import chat

# NEW:
from fantasy_assistant_v2 import chat_v2 as chat

# That's it! Everything else works the same.
```

**Advanced approach (A/B testing):**

```python
# In api_server.py, add version support:

# Add imports at top
from fantasy_assistant import chat as chat_v1
from fantasy_assistant_v2 import chat_v2

# Modify chat_endpoint() function:
@app.route("/api/chat", methods=["POST"])
@rate_limit(max_requests=30, window_seconds=60, key_prefix="chat")
@request_logger
@validate_request(validate_chat_request)
def chat_endpoint():
    try:
        validated_data = request.validated_data
        message = validated_data["message"]
        session_id = validated_data["session_id"]
        
        # Check for version parameter
        use_v2 = request.args.get('v2', 'false').lower() == 'true'
        
        # Get conversation history
        conversation_history = conversations.get(session_id)
        
        # Choose version
        if use_v2:
            response, updated_history = chat_v2(message, conversation_history)
        else:
            response, updated_history = chat_v1(message, conversation_history)
        
        # Rest of function stays the same...
```

Then test with:
```bash
# v1 (old)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Show standings"}'

# v2 (new)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/api/chat?v2=true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Compare top 3 teams"}'
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

### ✅ Functionality Tests

```bash
# Run the test suite
python3 test_query_enhancement.py
```

Expected results:
- [x] Query routing accuracy ≥ 75%
- [x] Query planning generates valid plans
- [x] Simple queries still work correctly
- [x] Complex queries now work

### ✅ Manual Tests

**Simple queries (should be fast, ≤1s):**
1. "Show me the standings"
2. "Who owns Patrick Mahomes?"
3. "Week 5 results"
4. "Recent trades"

**Complex queries (may take 2-3s):**
1. "Compare the rosters of playoff teams"
2. "How are my IR players performing?"
3. "Which team has made the most trades?"
4. "Who's the best QB in the league?"

**Cross-domain queries:**
1. "How are my starters performing compared to league leaders?"
2. "Which teams need to make moves to make playoffs?"
3. "Should I trade Player X for Player Y?"

### ✅ Performance Tests

Check response times:

```python
import time
from fantasy_assistant_v2 import chat_v2

# Test simple query
start = time.time()
response, _ = chat_v2("Show standings", None)
print(f"Simple query: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")  # Should be <1s

# Test complex query
start = time.time()
response, _ = chat_v2("Compare top 3 teams", None)
print(f"Complex query: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")  # Should be <3s
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong, rolling back is simple:

### If using Simple Approach (replaced v1):

```python
# In api_server.py, revert line 8:

# Change back from:
from fantasy_assistant_v2 import chat_v2 as chat

# To:
from fantasy_assistant import chat
```

### If using A/B Testing Approach:

```python
# Just set default to v1:
use_v2 = request.args.get('v2', 'false').lower() == 'true'
```

Or remove the v2 option entirely.

### Cleanup (if needed):

```bash
# Remove new files (optional, no harm in keeping them)
rm query_planner.py
rm fantasy_assistant_v2.py
rm test_query_enhancement.py
rm QUERY_ENHANCEMENT_GUIDE.md
rm MIGRATION_TO_V2.md
```

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Impact

| Query Type | v1 Latency | v2 Latency | Change |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Simple | ~500ms | ~500ms | No change |
| Complex (new capability) | N/A | ~2-3s | New feature |

**Key point:** Simple queries are **not slower**. Complex queries that v1 couldn't handle now take 2-3s.

### Cost Impact

**OpenAI API Usage:**
- Simple queries: Same token usage
- Complex queries: +10-20% tokens (due to planning step)

**Estimated monthly cost increase:** $2-5 for moderate usage

### Throughput

No impact. The system can still handle 30 requests/min/IP.

## Configuration Options

### Tuning Query Planner

You can adjust when the planner kicks in by editing `query_planner.py`:

```python
def should_use_planner(user_question: str) -> bool:
    """Determine if planning is needed"""
    
    # Make it more aggressive (plan more often):
    if any(word in question_lower for word in ["compare", "analyze", "best", "most"]):
        return True
    
    # Make it more conservative (plan less often):
    if len(user_question.split()) < 5:
        return False  # Very short questions use direct execution
    
    # Your custom logic here...
```

### Adjusting Planning Model

For cost optimization, the planner uses `gpt-4o-mini`. You can change this:

```python
# In query_planner.py, line ~70:
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Change to "gpt-4o" for better planning (more expensive)
    # or "gpt-3.5-turbo" for cheaper planning (less accurate)
    ...
)
```

### Temperature Control

Adjust creativity vs consistency:

```python
# In fantasy_assistant_v2.py:
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    temperature=0.7,  # Lower = more consistent, Higher = more creative
    ...
)
```

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch

**After deploying v2, monitor:**

1. **Response Time** (should stay ≤3s for 95th percentile)
2. **Error Rate** (should stay <1%)
3. **User Satisfaction** (via feedback or conversation completion)
4. **OpenAI Costs** (may increase 10-20%)

### Logging

The v2 system logs important events:

```python
# Check logs for:
# - Query routing decisions
# - Planning overhead
# - Function execution
# - Errors

tail -f app.log | grep "query_planner\|fantasy_assistant_v2"
```

### Useful Queries

```bash
# Count how often planner is used
grep "Using query planner" app.log | wc -l

# Count how often direct execution is used  
grep "Using direct execution" app.log | wc -l

# Check average planning time
grep "Query analysis complete" app.log | grep -oP "\d+ms"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Planner is too aggressive

**Symptom:** Simple queries are slow

**Fix:** Make `should_use_planner()` more conservative:

```python
def should_use_planner(user_question: str) -> bool:
    # Only plan for very complex queries
    return (
        len(user_question.split()) > 10 and
        any(word in user_question.lower() for word in ["compare", "analyze"])
    )
```

### Issue: Complex queries fail

**Symptom:** "Error analyzing query" messages

**Fix:** Check OpenAI API credentials and quota:

```python
# Test planning directly:
from query_planner import analyze_query
intent, plan = analyze_query("Compare top 3 teams")
print(f"Intent: {intent}")
print(f"Plan: {plan}")
```

### Issue: Responses are less accurate

**Symptom:** V2 responses don't match v1 quality

**Fix:** Increase planning model quality:

```python
# In query_planner.py:
model="gpt-4o",  # Instead of gpt-4o-mini
temperature=0.1  # More deterministic
```

---

## Best Practices

### Gradual Rollout

1. **Week 1:** Test v2 standalone, run test suite
2. **Week 2:** Deploy v2 with A/B testing, 10% of traffic
3. **Week 3:** Increase to 50% of traffic if metrics look good
4. **Week 4:** Full rollout (100% v2)

### User Communication

If you have multiple users, communicate the upgrade:

```
🎉 Assistant Upgrade Available!

Your fantasy football assistant just got smarter:
✅ Can now answer complex comparative questions
✅ Combines league data with NFL stats automatically
✅ Provides deeper insights and analysis

Try asking:
- "How are my IR players performing?"
- "Compare the top 3 teams' rosters"
- "Which teams need to make moves?"
```

### Feedback Collection

Add a feedback mechanism:

```python
# In your UI or API:
@app.route("/api/feedback", methods=["POST"])
def feedback():
    # Collect user feedback on responses
    session_id = request.json.get("session_id")
    rating = request.json.get("rating")  # 1-5
    comment = request.json.get("comment")
    
    # Store for analysis
    logger.info(f"Feedback for {session_id}: {rating}/5 - {comment}")
```
