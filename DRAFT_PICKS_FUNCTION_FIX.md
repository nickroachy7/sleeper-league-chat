# Draft Picks Function Fix - Complete! âœ…

## Problem
The fantasy assistant was making up draft pick data instead of querying the actual draft picks from the database. When asked "Who did nickroachy draft in 2024?", it would fabricate player names instead of showing the real picks.

## Root Cause
The assistant was using `dynamic_queries.py` for its function definitions, but the `get_team_draft_picks()` function was only added to `league_queries.py` and not to `dynamic_queries.py`.

## Solution

### 1. Added `get_team_draft_picks()` to dynamic_queries.py

Created a comprehensive function that:
- Searches for teams by name (fuzzy matching)
- Works across all seasons (2023, 2024, 2025)
- Returns actual draft picks from the database
- Includes player details (name, position, team, pick number, round)

**Function signature:**
```python
def get_team_draft_picks(team_name_search: str, season: str = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get all draft picks made by a specific team in a specific season's draft"""
```

### 2. Fixed Draft Picks Database Duplicates

**Issue:** Draft picks were duplicated 4x in the database due to multiple syncs.

**Fix:**
- Deleted duplicate records
- Added unique constraint: `(draft_id, pick_no)`
- Updated sync script to use proper upsert with `on_conflict`

### 3. Registered Function with AI Assistant

Added to `FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS` in `dynamic_queries.py`:
```python
{
    "name": "get_team_draft_picks",
    "description": "Get all draft picks made by a specific team in a specific season's draft...",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "team_name_search": {...},
            "season": {...}
        }
    }
}
```

Added to `FUNCTION_MAP`:
```python
FUNCTION_MAP = {
    ...
    "get_team_draft_picks": get_team_draft_picks,
    ...
}
```

### 4. Restarted API Server
Restarted `api_server.py` to load the new function definition.

## Verified Results

### 2024 Draft (nickroachy)
```
Team: Oof That Hurts
Owner: nickroachy
Season: 2024
Total Picks: 3

Picks:
  #10 (Rd 1): Xavier Worthy, WR, KC
  #13 (Rd 2): Michael Penix, QB, ATL
  #18 (Rd 2): Jonathon Brooks, RB, CAR
```

### 2023 Draft (nickroachy - startup draft)
```
Team: Oof That Hurts
Season: 2023
Total Picks: 24

First 5 picks:
  Jalen Hurts, QB
  Travis Kelce, TE
  Tyreek Hill, WR
  Kyle Pitts, TE
  Jerry Jeudy, WR
```

## What Works Now

The assistant can now accurately answer:
âœ… "Who did nickroachy draft in 2024?" â†’ Real data: Xavier Worthy, Michael Penix, Jonathon Brooks
âœ… "What did Oof That Hurts draft in 2023?" â†’ Real data: Jalen Hurts, Travis Kelce, etc.
âœ… "Show me [any team]'s draft picks from [any year]" â†’ Accurate historical data
âœ… Works for all 3 seasons (2023, 2024, 2025)
âœ… Fuzzy matching works (nickroachy, Oof That Hurts, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE draft_picks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    draft_id TEXT REFERENCES drafts(draft_id),
    player_id TEXT REFERENCES players(player_id),
    roster_id INTEGER,
    pick_no INTEGER,
    round INTEGER,
    draft_slot INTEGER,
    is_keeper BOOLEAN,
    UNIQUE(draft_id, pick_no)  -- âœ… NEW: Prevents duplicates
);
```

### Historical Season Support
The function handles historical seasons by:
1. Looking up the league_id for the requested season
2. Finding the team's roster_id in that season's league
3. Querying draft_picks for that specific draft_id and roster_id

### Cross-Season Team Lookup
```python
if season and league_id != SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID:
    # For historical seasons, query the specific league
    result = supabase.table('rosters').select(...).eq('league_id', league_id)
    # Fuzzy match against that season's rosters
else:
    # Current season - use find_team_by_name
    team_result = find_team_by_name(team_name_search)
```

## Files Modified

1. **dynamic_queries.py**
   - Added `get_team_draft_picks()` function
   - Added function to FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS
   - Added function to FUNCTION_MAP

2. **sync_sleeper_data.py**
   - Fixed draft_picks upsert to use `on_conflict='draft_id,pick_no'`

3. **Database (migration)**
   - Added unique constraint to draft_picks table
   - Removed duplicate records

## API Server Status
âœ… Running on http://localhost:5001
âœ… New function loaded and available
âœ… Ready to answer draft questions accurately

## Testing

Test the function directly:
```python
from dynamic_queries import get_team_draft_picks

# 2024 draft
result = get_team_draft_picks('nickroachy', '2024')
print(result)

# 2023 draft
result = get_team_draft_picks('Oof That Hurts', '2023')
print(result)
```

Test via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Who did nickroachy draft in 2024?"}'
```

## Summary

The fantasy assistant now has complete, accurate access to all draft data across all 3 seasons and will use the real database instead of making up information. The `get_team_draft_picks()` function is fully integrated and ready to use! ðŸŽ‰
