### 2. Comprehensive Data Fetching

**Changed from:**
- `limit=10` (small sample)

**To:**
- `limit=200` (comprehensive history)

### 3. Smart Data Formatting  

**Changed from:**
- Massive JSON dumps

**To:**
- Readable trade summaries
- "Trade 1: Team A gave X, received Y"
- Digestible format for analysis

### 4. Explicit Analysis Instructions

**Added final prompt:**
```
YOUR TASK AS ANALYST:

## Expected Output Now

### The Question
"Who made the worst trade in league history?"

### What You Should Get

```
After analyzing all 147 trades in league history, the worst trade 
was clearly made by Javier's Silk Road in Season 2025, Week 6.

THE TRADE:
Javier's Silk Road gave away:
- Zay Flowers (WR, BAL) - productive WR2/3
- Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR, ARI) - first-round rookie
- 2027 2nd Round Pick
- 2026 2nd Round Pick

Received:
- Jordan Addison (WR, MIN)  
- 2026 & 2027 1st Round Picks

WHY THIS IS THE WORST:

1. VALUE MISMATCH
   - Gave up TWO productive WRs for ONE
   - Harrison Jr. is elite rookie talent
   - Flowers was averaging 14.3 PPG

2. DRAFT CAPITAL LOSS
   - Traded multiple 2nd rounders
   - Received picks further out (less valuable)
   - Net negative in pick value

3. IMMEDIATE IMPACT
   - Team dropped from 5-1 to 6-5 after trade
   - Lost WR depth critical for playoffs
   - Missed playoffs by 1 game

VERDICT: This trade cost Javier's Silk Road their season.
Rating: 2/10 trade ⭐⭐

## Key Principle

```
🎯 BE THE ANALYST, DON'T JUST SHOW DATA

Good: "After analyzing all trades, the worst was..."
Bad:  "Here are the trades. You can analyze them."

Good: "Team A has the best QB situation because..."
Bad:  "Here are the QB rosters for each team."

Good: "I recommend targeting Player X for these 3 reasons..."
Bad:  "Here are some available players."
```
