# 🚀 Quick Start: MCP Integration

## What Just Happened?

Your AI assistant can now use **BOTH** data sources:
- 🗄️ **Supabase** for fantasy league data
- 🏈 **Ball Don't Lie MCP** for real NFL stats

## Example Questions That Now Work

| Question | Data Source | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| "Who owns AJ Brown?" | Supabase | Checks your league rosters |
| "How many TDs did AJ Brown have last game?" | Ball Don't Lie | Gets real NFL game stats |
| "Show standings" | Supabase | Your league data |
| "Compare Mahomes vs Allen stats" | Ball Don't Lie | Real NFL season stats |
| "Recent trades" | Supabase | Your league transactions |

## 🔧 To Complete Setup (3 Steps)

### 1. Initialize Your MCP Client

Edit `external_stats.py` line 16:

```python
def get_mcp_client():
    global _mcp_client
    if _mcp_client is None:
        # ADD YOUR MCP INITIALIZATION HERE
        # Example:
        # from ball_dont_lie import NFLStatsClient
        # _mcp_client = NFLStatsClient(api_key="...")
        pass
    return _mcp_client
```

### 2. Implement MCP Calls

Update these 4 functions in `external_stats.py`:
- `get_player_game_stats()` - Line 24
- `get_player_season_stats()` - Line 59
- `get_team_game_stats()` - Line 88
- `compare_players()` - Line 115

Replace the placeholder returns with actual MCP calls.

### 3. Test!

```bash
python3 fantasy_assistant.py
```

Try: "How many TDs did AJ Brown have last game?"

## ✨ The Power of This Setup

Your AI can now answer questions like:

> "Compare AJ Brown's real NFL stats to his performance on my fantasy team"

This would:
1. Get AJ Brown's NFL stats (Ball Don't Lie)
2. Check who owns him in your league (Supabase)
3. Get his fantasy points from matchups (Supabase)
4. Compare and present analysis

All in one conversational answer! 🎉
