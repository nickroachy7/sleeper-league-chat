| `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | MCP server config | ✅ Updated |

## 📝 Important Notes

### Data Availability
- **Ball Don't Lie API** may have limited recent NFL data
- Some stats might be historical (2019-2023)
- Current season (2024) data may be incomplete
- This is a limitation of the Ball Don't Lie API, not your integration

### Name Matching
The system intelligently handles player name variations:
- "AJ Brown" → finds "A.J. Brown" ✅
- "Patrick Mahomes" → finds "Patrick Mahomes" ✅
- "Mahomes" → finds "Patrick Mahomes" ✅
- Automatically tries: exact match → formatted name → last name

### Error Handling
If a player isn't found, try:
1. Last name only: "Brown" instead of "AJ Brown"
2. Full name with proper formatting: "A.J. Brown"
3. Check if player is in the Ball Don't Lie database

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Integration
```python
