# Season Auto-Detection Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Ball Don't Lie MCP integration to automatically detect and use the current NFL season based on the current date, eliminating hardcoded season years.

## Changes Made

### 1. **external_stats.py**

#### Added Date/Season Detection Functions:
```python
def get_current_nfl_season() -> int:
    """
    Determine the current NFL season based on the current date.
    NFL seasons run from September to February, so:
    - September-December: current year's season
    - January-August: previous year's season
    """
    now = datetime.now()
    if now.month >= 9:  # September or later
        return now.year
    else:  # January-August
        return now.year - 1

def get_current_date() -> str:
    """Get the current date in ISO format"""
    return datetime.now().date().isoformat()
```

#### Updated Functions:
- **`get_player_game_stats()`**: Now accepts optional `season` parameter, auto-detects current season if not provided
- **`get_player_season_stats()`**: Uses `get_current_nfl_season()` instead of hardcoded 2024

#### Function Definitions:
- Added `season` parameter to function schemas
- Updated descriptions to mention automatic season detection

### 2. **fantasy_assistant.py**

#### Added Current Context to System Prompt:
```python
# Get current date and NFL season for context
CURRENT_DATE = datetime.now().strftime("%B %d, %Y")  # e.g., "October 23, 2025"
CURRENT_NFL_SEASON = get_current_nfl_season()

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are a helpful fantasy football assistant for a fantasy league on Sleeper. 

ðŸ“… CURRENT CONTEXT:
- Today's Date: {CURRENT_DATE}
- Current NFL Season: {CURRENT_NFL_SEASON}
...
```

## How It Works

### Season Detection Logic:
- **October 23, 2025** â†’ NFL Season: **2025**
- **February 15, 2025** â†’ NFL Season: **2024** (still in 2024 season which runs into early 2025)
- **September 5, 2025** â†’ NFL Season: **2025** (new season starts)

### When Querying MCP:
1. If no season specified â†’ Uses `get_current_nfl_season()`
2. Queries Ball Don't Lie API with correct season
3. Returns current season's data automatically

## Benefits

âœ… **No Manual Updates**: Season automatically updates as calendar progresses  
âœ… **Date Aware**: AI knows current date and context  
âœ… **Accurate Data**: Always queries the correct NFL season  
âœ… **Flexible**: Can still manually specify season for historical queries  

## Testing

Tested with Patrick Mahomes on October 23, 2025:
- âœ… Auto-detected 2025 NFL season
- âœ… Retrieved Week 7 stats (Oct 19, 2025)
- âœ… Correct opponent and statistics

## Example Queries

The AI can now answer:
- "How many TDs did AJ Brown have last game?" â†’ Uses 2025 season
- "What are Mahomes' season stats?" â†’ Uses 2025 season  
- "Show me Travis Kelce's 2024 stats" â†’ Uses specified 2024 season
- "Did Josh Allen throw for 300 yards last week?" â†’ Uses 2025 season

The system automatically knows what "this season" and "current" mean based on today's date!
